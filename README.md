# Rainfall Station Measurements in Victoria, AU - Extreme Value Statistics Analysis

This repository presents the analysis of rainfall station measurements in the state of Victoria, AU. The data files, named Gteam_number.RData, contain three objects: a data frame with measurements from five locations, corresponding dates, and geographical coordinates.

## Exploratory Analysis

The database was explored using descriptive statistics. The analysis goes beyond the provided example, including additional visualizations like histograms, anomaly detection, and trend removal.

## Extreme Value Theory Assessment

The exploratory analysis aimed to assess if the data satisfies classical assumptions in Extreme Value Theory (EVT) like stationarity, mixing, and the existence of a maximum domain of attraction.

## Univariate Extreme Value Analysis

A comprehensive univariate extreme value analysis was performed for the variable and locations assigned. Both block-maxima and peaks-over-threshold approaches were considered.

- The presence of a maximum domain of attraction and heaviness of the variable's tail were investigated.
- Tail index/shape parameter estimation was conducted to deduce extreme probabilities and quantiles.

## Extremal Index Study

For at least one of the locations, an investigation into the extremal index of the time series was carried out. The effect on the estimation of probabilities and extreme quantiles was assessed.

The entire analysis was completed for the Extreme Value Statistics course (MP15) at Mines ParisTech. The findings and results are available in this repository.
